# Exercising of Android Services, Threads and Broadcast

## Proposed exercise
Create an Android login application that uses a "POST" request to the url "http://ag-ifpb-sgd-server.herokuapp.com/login" using the parameters of the form "email" and "password" . Use "OkHttp" as HTTP communication technology. Additionally, do:
  - by clicking the "Access" button, disable it and rename it to "Please wait"
  - when you receive the result of the access attempt, rename back to "Access" and enable it,
  - then report, via Toast whether there was success or failure in the attempt.
